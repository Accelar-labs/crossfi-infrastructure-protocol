A "babel for the Cosmos", Telescope is a TypeScript Transpiler for Cosmos Protobufs. Telescope is used to generate libraries for Cosmos blockchains. Simply point to your protobuffer files and create developer-friendly Typescript libraries for teams to build on your blockchain.

The following blockchain libraries (generated by Telescope) are available via npm

* [akashjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/akashjs)
* [comdex](https://www.npmjs.com/package/comdex)
* [osmojs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/osmojs)
* [pylonsjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pylonsjs)
* [stargazejs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/stargazejs)

## Quickstart

Follow the instructions below to generate a new Typescript package that you can publish to npm.

First, install `telescope`:

```sh
npm install -g @osmonauts/telescope
```

### Generate

Use the `generate` command to create a new package. 

```sh
telescope generate
cd ./your-new-project
yarn 
```
### Add Protobufs

If you have `.proto` files, simply add them to a `./proto` folder.

However, if you want to get started quickly using existing protos from our registry, simply use the `install` command.

```sh
telescope install
```

It's not necessary, but you may also specify specific packages, e.g.

```sh
telescope install @protobufs/osmosis
```

### Transpile

To create the Typescript files, run the `transpile` command. 

```sh
telescope transpile
```

You should now seem some `.ts` files generated in `./src`. These are the real source files used in your application.

### Build

Finally, run `install` and `buidl` to generate the JS and types for publishing your module to npm.

```sh
yarn install
yarn buidl
```
